Try it yourself: [https://cryptotrack-live.vercel.app](https://cryptotrack-live.vercel.app)

## Important

Data are updated once user changes any of settings, i.e. currency, update rate, it can be live if you uncomment marked parts of code in Data.svelte (expect higher usage of your daily credits on API.)

(If the updating is live and you tab out the page it will stop updating, it will start again if you are on the page)

## Features

- Currency convert
- More features to come...
