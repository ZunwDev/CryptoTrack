- Implemented settings modification for phones using the burger menu functionality.
- Incorporated fixed backgrounds for menus on smaller devices to enhance user experience.

## Version 0.15.3.1 Beta

### Changes & Fixes

- Overhauled menu display to ensure that opening a new menu automatically hides the previous one. This enhancement restricts the visibility of only one menu at a time.

  - Other outdated media links persist due to limitations in the API.

### Fixes

- Rectified the issue where the chart height on smaller devices was insufficient, resulting in truncated content at the bottom.

### Technical

- The chart on the detail page might not reflect precise accuracy due to its dependence on the prices returned by the API. While the displayed prices encompass the data available, achieving absolute accuracy is limited by the data source. However, the chart does offer a representation of significant milestones for the coin, notably indicating approximate periods of its peak value over time.

## Version 0.15.2.1 Beta

- Users receive an "N/A" warning when attempting to convert to unsupported currencies within the market table.

### Refinements and Optimizations

## Version 0.15 Beta

### New features

- Added coin news
  - latest news based on what coin you are looking on
  - there's also news from twitter and reddit, but they aren't reliable that much (some of them are really old (even few years))

### Up and coming

- Next update will bring currency converting directly in the detail page, i.e. turn usd into eur etc. and also chart zoom probably

## Version 0.14.4 Beta

### Changes

- Refined chart loading in the detail page for optimized performance.
- Enhanced chart responsiveness to screen resizing, ensuring a seamless experience across different screen sizes - (it doesn't matter on phones because on phone it's going to load just fine)
- Conducted extensive code refactoring, resulting in cleaner and more optimized codebase.
- Implemented improved media handling, clearing old media when users switch coins in the detail page.
- Streamlined chart loading: now, when a user revisits the detail page, the chart won't be destroyed but will update with smooth animations. This change doesn't apply to the charts on home page, since it wouldn't work
- Prevented users from backtracking through detail pages, ensuring a direct return to the home page.
- Enhanced market data loading by selectively updating only the necessary data instead of refreshing everything.

### Fixes

- Rectified data loading issues on the detail page, preventing redundant reloads when switching pages in the markets table.
- Resolved multiple data loading instances on the detail page, enhancing overall performance by preventing unnecessary data loading.

### Up and coming

- Prepared and structured news data, focusing on English language content, news will be pursuant to what coin is user viewing, i.e. if user is on bitcoin it will show only/mostly news about bitcoin, these go for every coin (not sure if less-known coins will have any news)
- Prepared store for chart zoom (1d, 3d, 7d etc upto one year)

### Technical

- If you are in detail page, and update the codebase with live deploy/update, the chart doesn't load => refresh fixes it (doesn't affect users)
- Upon returning to a locally hosted detail page and navigating back (popstate), users are redirected to the deployed app instead of the local host.
- Added aliases @ for paths instead of ../../.. etc., these go for all main folders (types doesn't work for some reason, any else do)
